The provisional name for this is Dance Humanism.

Unlike all other Holy texts I know of, this one is not perfect and in fact it will be updated as needed, hopefully with the help and influence of others more capable than me.

I'm writing this primarily for myself, and "for anyone who could be interested"; I don't see this as an exercise in convincing people *away* from whatever beliefs they may have already, ie I'm deliberately preaching to the choir.

Full versioning and commit authorship will be always available.

I will also strive to quote the relevant peer-reviewed literature whenever needed.


Sincerely yours,

a Prophet
