The provisional name for this is Dance Humanism.

Unlike all other Holy texts I know of, this one is not perfect and in fact it will be updated as needed.
Full versioning and commit authorship will be always available.
I will also strive to quote the relevant peer-reviewed literature whenever needed.

Sincerely yours,
  - a Prophet
