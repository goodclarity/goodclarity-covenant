Goodclarity Covenant
--------------------
_A semi-serious philosophical exercise._

I guess you can think of this as the Holy text of the Goodclaritan religion, but it is actually several different things:

* not something to take seriously.
* it is something fun and damn interesting to write.
* it is my attempt at seeing clearly my own convictions, bringing clarity to my ideas and beliefs about Life, the Universe and Everything.
* it is an attempt, however naive, at formalising secular humanism, or at least part of it.
* it is a way to reach out and throw these ideas in the public arena to be shredded, improved, considered or ignored.

It is also NOT several things:

* it is not something you should take too seriously.
* unlike all other Holy texts I know of, this one is not perfect and in fact it will be updated as needed.
* it is not an attempt to convince anyone *away* from their beliefs (which means that yes, I'm deliberately preaching to the choir).

This will be a continuous work in progress, both philosophically and literarily (is "literarily" a word?) and could not be otherwise.

Full versioning and commit authorship will be always available.

I will also strive to quote the relevant peer-reviewed literature whenever needed.


Sincerely yours,

a human
