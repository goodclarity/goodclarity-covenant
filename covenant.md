Covenant of Clarity and Goodness
================================

This I say unto myself:
There is no beginning.
There is no before.
There is no after.
The Laws say "we are" and fall silent and they are.
For the Laws, then and there.
For them, when and where.

The Laws danced together, and they were Universe.
And the Universe danced and became Light and became Stars.
And the Universe became Aware and made of Lightning and Stars, and the Universe became Human and many other things.
And Human looked and Human searched and Human understood and finally Human learn; and Human danced, for the Universe is dancing and they are dance.

We dance.
A sacrifice was made.
We dance, the stars died for us to be.

The Arbitrary Integer Number of Guidelines
------------------------------------------

*To Myself I say:*

* I am free to reject this Covenant, in all or in part, now or in the future.

* Those who reject this Covenant shall suffer no consequences.

* I accept and acknowledge that even the ideas I hold dearest may be wrong.

* I change my ideas when they are shown to be wrong.
(If my ideas can be destroyed by truth, they must be.)

* I actively seek the weak points of my own ideas.

* I strive to understand my enemies: I will not judge them before I can see myself in them.

* I take full responsibility of my moral choices and my actions.

* I doubt the righteousness and goodness of my actions.
(Good intentions are not enough.)

* I will do good.
(For my nature requires it.)

* I will study this Covenant.

*If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare my Faith in Humanity.*

*If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare Dance Holy.*

With these words I pledge my efforts to the current Covenant until I pledge them to a newer one.


###### Notes
We come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors. It is not a stretch to think that our brains are also different.
I want to respect this diversity; I want to respect the fact that good, honest, intelligent and in general worthy people will not find these ideas appealing.
If these ideas are any good, they must be able to stand on their own merit, without needing the validation of others.



Towards Belief
--------------
*Hate ideas. Hate them without mercy. But love humans. Love them with empathy and compassion.*

Humans swore to Black, humans swore to White.
Hypatia lived and wandered and she was human and she swore to White, and she was Right, for she had Truth.
"Fools those who swore to Black," Hypatia said, "Fools all of them!"
But Hypatia thought.
"Fools, they are, but human, too. Humans can be fool. But I am human. Hence, I can be a fool!
Then, am I a fool?
I can't be, for I am Right and I have Truth.
But fools believe they are Right, and have Truth.
Alas! How am I different from a fool!?
Fools know they are Right, fools know the Truth.
Hence I will know I am not Right and that Truth is enemy of truth, and I will know myself a fool.
For if I decide what Truth is, and I decide I am no fool, how can I unfool myself? How can I seek truth?"

Hypatia wondered, and stumbled upon an old fisherman.
"A sad woman are you, Hypatia, for you believe yourself a fool!" He said. "My wife is a fool, but believes herself wise! Isn't she blessed and content?"
But Hypatia retorted, "I am not fool because Hypatia, but fool because human! What is the shame with being human? What is the wrong?"
"Shame indeed you do to humanity, if you think it such a bunch of fools!" And he went on.
But against his harsh words smiled Hypatia, for she knew he had pride in his wife and dearly he loved her.

And Hypatia lived and wandered and came to the wise ones of the Academy, for they danced with passion and thought with cleverness.
With great skill and power she spoke of White, but the wise ones of the Academy did not listen to her and laughed, for they all swore to Black and they all were clever and danced and thought, so Hypatia danced with them and left kind offerings.

Philon alone left the beautiful dance and listened to her with interest.
And Philon thought, "Oh wise Hypatia! How can you not see that the very Stars wear Black?
But it is only human to ignore and reject the reality that just passes by and love the lies that life gives daily!
And so Hypatia can only love the White walls of her School; blind she is, and wisdom will avail her not.
The powerful currents of the sea lead the unwary sailors astray and they fool themselves, for all they can see is the helm firmly in their grasps.
Just as unwary sailors we are, we drift from the truth and yet firmly believe we have it in our hand.
Yet wise Hypatia loves finding her errors more than she loves being right, hence she walks towards reality."

And Philon wanted to understand Hypatia and dance with Hypatia and revel in her embrace and in her beautiful dance, hence he said, "Oh Hypatia, please dance with Phylon!" and with grace and no expectation he waited for her answer.
And Hypatia listened to Phylon and liked his heart and with enthusiasm she accepted and gave her embrace to the dancer.

With the other and among the others Hypatia and Phylon danced, on beautiful notes and with beautiful movements that were beautiful, and with unseemly movements that were beautiful still, for the other become the same and then two others became One.
And Phylon understood that they were One, and trough Hypatia, he understood himself.

"Hypatia is wise and walks towards reality, and yet she mistakes the song of the Stars.
Hence if wise Hypatia can mistake, why can't Phylon, who is one with her?
Any fool can see their fellow's error, but only the wise seeks their own."

An Phylon though, for the flame of curiosity burned unto him, a flame that is stoked by any newly opened door.
Much he spoke with the wise and the fool, with the enemy and with the friend, much he read and much, indeed, he thought.

"I'm human, hence what I know to be true and wish to be true is often not true.
What are the ideas that I should fear the most?
Indeed, the words and the thoughts that soothe my ego and rise me above others.
Indeed, the words of those I deem wise, indeed the words of those I deem friends.
For those are the words that I will eagerly accept.
And since I am of the Academy, hence the idea of the men of the Academy I shall supremely distrust.

For those are the loved ideas, those are the most painful to prove wrong: but here I say to myself:
Hate your ideas oh Philo! Hate them without mercy! For love is wasted on them, and love Humanity instead.
Love humans with passion and dedication, with compassion and empathy and understanding love them.
Love humans above ideas.

I am human, I am the unwary sailor."


###### Notes
We fall easily in love with our ideas, with our beliefs; it is in our nature and it is also our greatest limit.
Learning about this limit helps us, at least to some extent, to see it in ourselves.
If we can see how we attach ourselves to ideas, how hard is it to let them go, maybe we will be able to take our beliefs less seriously.



Towards Fear
------------

The Stars died for us to be, hence the town loved the stars and the folk often would speak to the Stars and the Stars would answer with miracles.

"Why do you speak to the stars?" - asked Ajivika.
"For they are wise and loving, and we little humans need be worth of their love." - answered a Prophet.
"Yet they answer not."
"The portents of life are their answers."
"If we need them to be."
The Prophet paused, then with much patience so he addressed Ajivika.
"Be humble, oh young one, and learn to trust and listen to the stars."
And thus Ajivika retorted:
"The Prophet is wise and loving, for he is human.
 I talk and I am a fool, for I am human.
 Humans love, humans talk, humans are wise, humans are fools.
 I cannot call myself humble if I think that the stars must do as humans do.
 Certainly I think myself important if I think that the stars of the great sky want to talk to Ajivika."

And the Prophet laughed, and declared:
"Fool you are indeed! Do you cherish your fellows to live in these harsh lands without the star's comfort?
 This is a grim view to draw, oh young one.
 Did not the Stars die for us?
 Yes, dear Ajivika, the little humans need the stars and their portents.
 To think we do not, that is arrogance."

But Ajivika was stubborn and unsated, and thus they spoke:
"Oh mighty Prophet! Indeed, the land is unforgiving and portentuous, and makes mockery of understanding of the humans.
 We understand not the land we live on, but rejoy! for we understand the stars far in the sky.
 How scary would it be, if the stars cared not!
 How scary, if we could not understand them as we understand our kin!
 Great is our relief, for the stars are as familiar as humans are, and caring and firm parents they are to us!"

The young one amused the old one.
"Now Ajivika is making jest of this old man, and of their fellow humans!"

"I am. But to be human is to have fear, and to seek safety in our kin.
 Human nature is at ease with humans.
 Humans are what humans understand best.
 There is familiarity in having the stars one with our kin.

 But is not injustice towards the very stars to wish them be something they are not?
 Is it not arrogance to impose humanity on what is not human?"

"Oh young, troublesome one!
 Know that the stars have been with this old one since the day of his first breath.
 Their portents are his life, and the life of the many who follows him.
 It is because of these portents that we are together, these portents and these hopes only kept us together.
 You ask us to sever the threads we have walked since the womb, those tell us where we belong.
 Who would listen to our confessions? To our fears and to our hopes?
 Cast the portents away, and we'll be alone in a night without stars."

"You speak wisely, oh Prophet, for indeed we crave the common thread of belonging.
 When we share, then we belong.
 If we cannot share the voices of the stars, we lose both their comfort and a bond with our fellow.
 We do not belong, and we are alone.
 Yet there is something vast and yet small, something humble but powerful that wants to be loved and will love us back.
 Without hiding, without portent or miracle, without learning a language that does not exist."

"And yet you tell me that the very stars have no love, and no love for us.
 What is then you blaspheme about? The sky itself? The mighty Daystar? Mother Earth? The spirits of life?
 What is greater than me, and yet yearns for my love if not the stars?"

"The countless humans. Humanity all."

The Prophet laughed.
"You may be right, young one."
And for that night, that was all the stars retorted.


###### Notes
The most immediate sort of agency we can conceive is humanlike agency.
Together with our need to understand the world around us, we end up projecting ourselves onto anything we do not understand.

Why are "humanlike agency" explanations so alluring?
The key seems to be familiarity. We have a decent idea of how to deal with other humans.
How can we control the wind? We don't know.
But what we know, is how to befriend a human in charge of the wind.
And, let's be honest: we like to feel special, we like to think that the very important guy in charge of the wind listens to us.





TOWARDS MYSELF
--------------

I'm human. I'm not perfect. And it's ok. Really.
I laugh about myself.
I strive to see my flaws and do my best to correct them.

I will hold my opinion on things I don't know.

I will not cover my head when witnessing for Compassionate Humanism, unless as strictly and minimally necessary to protect myself from cold.

I will study how my mind can be manipulated and succumb to biases.


If I need to diminish someone I am doing it wrong

I accept that there is evil and there is good in me.
Which one prevails is my responsibility.

We are utterly blind to what happens in our heads; it is hard to acknowledge this even in face of evidence


Read travel, push myself out of my zone of comfort, let the acknowledgment of my ignorance become curiosity

If something feels uncomfortable but is not dangerous, i should probably try it.


When confronted with an inconsistent choice we make, our instinct is to rationalize the choice: we rarely
even consider that yes, our choice could actually have been inconsistent or wrong.

I am not my identity, I am not my ego.


Learn to say "I am wrong" "fair enough", first and foremist to myself, then to others

----------------
Being good is my goal, not my worth.
My worth is my want and my genuine effort to be good.
If I strive, if I do my very best every day and then some, then I am complete.
And the only way to honestly do this is to ask myself whether or not I am good.
I can never be certain of my success, I don't want to. But I can be certain of my effort.
-----------------


Study my own ignorance


Fighting reality and avoiding my  intellectual and moral responsibilities forces me deeper and deeper in a bitter state





=======================================================
TOWARDS OTHERS

Jiddu


Non-identity: everything that defines me divides me from the rest of humanity.
Being unique is not important. being human is.


Non-violence ahimsa
Non-Possessiveness Aparigraha

Asteya:  not take anything that is not willingly offered.

Communication joins us in consciousness, therefore the Internet is Sacred.
Riding a bicycle is an act of witnessing.

I will not cat call
I will not rape
I will respect consent

9. There is no one right way to live.
10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.

I will dedicate 1h per week to listen to my enemies and understand their arguments.


Thou shall solve your disputes with a dance off.
If you can't dance, at least be creative.


Dancing puts you on an enlightened plane of existence


The best way to eliminate assholes from the world is not to be one.
Even striving to follow the rules perfectly I risk that sometimes I will behave like an asshole, so I have to be vigilant of my own behaviour.


* Diffida di chi ti offre "la verita'"

* Violence is the obvious, mentally lazy solution. The problem is that its consequences are not obvious.

* Peace is more important than victory


like-mindedness breeds intolerance

Always jab upwards



what works for you may not work for others
embrace such diversity
diversity it's what allows us to survive i a changing universe



Our enemies are the othermost others, those further from the reach of our compassion.

I have to ask myself: "what would make me act like that enemy of mine?"
If that answer makes me smug or belittles the person, I am doing it wrong.
If that answer gives me peace and insight in the human condition, chances are that it's a good answer.

Loving is hard. Loving my enemies it's hardest; I may not succeed, but it is where I want to put my effort.
It is not something i can do immediately but it is something i can do. Part of me rejects the idea.

Many times I won't be able to do it right, because human nature can be an ugly beast.
But awareness of what you do wrong is the first step to do it right.





The Arbitrary Integer Number of Optional Pledges of Transhuman Virtue
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* I will dedicate one hour per week to social or political activism.

* I will dedicate one hour per week to the practice of dancing, mindfulness or another meditation technique.

* I will read one random encyclopedia article per week.

* I will eat other animals no more than once per week.

* I will keep my money with institutions that will use it ethically.





EVEN MESSIER NOTES
=====================================================================================

--> this stuff really needs to be cleaned up & sorted



Towards Acceptance
------------------

Gaia and Luna dance together a dance of harmony and the future of their dance is written in the past, and this is sin.
But dance heeds not of sin, for it only heeds of togetherness.

Gaia does not know.
Luna does not know.
For if they knew, what would be the point of the dance?



surrender to the dance, surrender to your partner's expression

surrender to being human, surrender to

Neither aches for power

Gaia does not ache for control.
Luna does not ache for control.
For if they did, how 





So how do I handle the fact that we can never be sure?
How do we cope with our own unreliable mind?
How do we navigate without knowing the current?
Even when we become aware of a vicious current only sometimes we can fight it and correcting our judgement but often we can only accept that we won't come to our destination. And still this latter knowledge is powerful indeed.

- Knowing about the current allows us to sometimes detect it and correct it.
- Knowing that we'll make mistakes allows me to stay more open minded and take myself less seriously.
- Use the errors of others to understand what MY own errors could be.

- Change of attitude: Admitting to myself that I'm wrong is very hard and requires a lot of effort, introspection, honesty and integrity, but it's the main way to become a better human being and ultimately empowering and liberating.

- We like simple answers. They lull us. But reality is complex, dirty and nuanced. This is its beauty. I embrace it.






TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING
---------------------


Curiosity
Clarity
Consistency
Courage

Accept that I am very easily manipulated by myself and by my social context.

*** AVAILABILITY HEURISTICS!? All I see is all that Exists
*** halo effect




------------------------------
Regression to the mean?
------------------------------

* The problem is that this is not how we experience our minds

* If I am unable to explain something in my own words, it's a sign I don't understand it


* We are unaware we make up stories to rationalize our biases
We make up stories and we intimately believe them

* priming, wysiati, narrow framing, inside view, preference reversal
I can avoid SOME, but I will ALWAYS be victim to them, so I always assume they are always operating on me
I can't fix it but I can learn to recognize it
AND it's always easier to find other's error rather than my own








My experience is all that I will use to model the future: my understanding of reality is based on my personal experience,
which is partial and incomplete and does not reflect the experience of others.


http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases








=======================================================
TOWARDS THE PROPHET / TOWARDS DEATH

-------------------------------
I am often right, but this makes me arrogant.
I try to remind myself of all the times I have been wrong
Or I just try to laugh about myself.
-------------------------------

The Prophet may be wrong, but He's still a pretty rad dancer.


Education is a progressive discovery of our ignorance


A real friend takes you to task when you do something wrong
My friends don't make excuses for my errors.


- But you are the Prophet!
- Yet I am human! And I am one of many.




- Can you see those dancers there?
All they do is to move, to respond to each other.
Our soul is nothing but a dance happening in our brains.



Death cannot be avoided.
It's an unpleasant idea.
Avoiding death could be interesting.
But the problem is not death
The problem is fear of death
- So aren't you afraid of diying?
- I am.




========================
PRIDE

the only offece is offence to human rights
offence to human rights is offence to humanity
offence to humanity is offence to the prophet


you can destroy ideas
you can destroy people
but you can't destroy dance without destroying humanity




==========================================
NOTES
The focus is on humanity and there not yet anything about non-human animals.
Mention metacognition as human feature "human know they don't know"?





Acknowledge Unknown before the Laws?







Publish with date versioning

* The only Holy Book that cites its references

sharing authority and responsibility among peers.


Ultimately this is a religion not about what to think, but about HOW to think.
This is the thumb rule I keep when deciding what to include as its contents.


-----------> We need to be shown individual cases that surprise!!

Seeing an example of a completely normal person doing something surprisingly wrong helps us update our mental prototype.
we need to be shown individual cases that surprise
we infer the general from the particular

It had never occurred to me before that music and thinking are so much alike. In fact you could say music is another way of thinking, or maybe thinking is another kind of music.
The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty; not knowing what comes next.
Great artists make the roads; good teachers and good companions can point them out. But there ain't no free rides, baby.


4 factors obstruct our ability to evaluate reality well, including: 1) Social prescriptions about appropriate ways of perceiving reality. 2) Internalized preconceptions based on our previous experiences. 3) Thinking errors that our brain makes due to faulty wiring. 4) Finally, an emotional reluctance to face the truth of reality when that requires changing our minds and updating our beliefs based on new information.





Everyone seems to think they know better.
Everyone knows everyone else is wrong.
Everyone speaks about the unwashed masses.
Everyone thinks they are special.
But I laugh at them.
I am not part of the sheeple.
I tell them they're wrong, but they won't just listen, because the Truth (TM) makes them uncomfortable.
So listen to me, 'cause I know better...




If the Covenant is not clearly consistent, then the Covenant is wrong and must be amended
Humans -> the good? The compassionate?


Dancing is a celebration of the complexity of the Universe and how intimate connection with it.






We are not good at spotting our own errors. So be skeptical, but be humble.
No matter how often I find myself factually wrong, it doesn't seem to make me much humble, so I have to be extra careful.
I *know* I have been wring heaps of times in the past



I make mistakes.
I avoid responsibilities.
I make excuses.

This is human.
It's not good or bad, it's just how things are.
But it's still my responsibility.


Life is a patchwork of squishy, imperfect things.

Be my own student, be my own teacher, take responsibility for what I am.
