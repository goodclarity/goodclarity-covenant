This I say unto myself.


Dance Humanism
==============


There is no beginning.
There is no before.
There is no after.
The Laws say "we are" and fall silent and they are.
For the Laws, then and there.
For them, when and where.

The Laws danced together, and they were Universe.
And the Universe danced and became Light and became Stars.
And the Universe became Aware and made of Lightning and Stars, and the Universe became Human and many other things.
And Human looked and Human searched and Human understood and finally Human learn; and Human danced, for the Universe is dancing and they are dance.

We dance.
A sacrifice was made.
We dance, the stars died for us to be.






================================================================
COVENANTS

To Myself I say:

I am free to reject this Covenant, in all or in part, now or in the future.

Those who reject this Covenant shall suffer no consequences.

I accept and acknowledge that even the ideas I hold dearest may be wrong.

I change my ideas when they are shown to be wrong.
(If my ideas can be destroyed by truth, they must be.)

I actively seek the weak points of my own ideas.

I strive to understand my enemies: I will not judge them before I can see myself in them.

I take full responsibility of my moral choices and my actions.

I doubt the righteousness and goodness of my actions.
(Good intentions are not enough.)

I will do good.
(For my nature requires it.)

I will study this Covenant.

If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare my Faith in Humanity.
If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare Dance Holy.

With these words I pledge my efforts to the current Covenant until I pledge them to a newer one.





================================================================
TOWARDS BELIEF

"Hate ideas. Hate them without mercy. But love humans. Love them with empathy and compassion."


Humans swore to Black, humans swore to White.
Hypatia lived and wandered and she was human and she swore to White, and she was Right, for she had Truth.
"Fools those who swore to Black," Hypatia said, "Fools all of them!"
But Hypatia thought.
"Fools, they are, but human, too. Humans can be fool. But I am human. Hence, I can be a fool!
Then, am I a fool?
I can't be, for I am Right and I have Truth.
But fools believe they are Right, and have Truth.
Alas! How am I different from a fool!?
Fools know they are Right, fools know the Truth.
Hence I will know I am not Right and that Truth is enemy of truth, and I will know myself a fool.
For if I decide what Truth is, and I decide I am no fool, how can I unfool myself? How can I seek truth?"

Hypatia wondered, and stumbled upon an old fisherman.
"A sad woman are you, Hypatia, for you believe yourself a fool!" He said. "My wife is a fool, but believes herself wise! Isn't she blessed and content?"
But Hypatia retorted, "I am not fool because Hypatia, but fool because human! What is the shame with being human? What is the wrong?"
"Shame indeed you do to humanity, if you think it such a bunch of fools!" And he went on.
But against his harsh words smiled Hypatia, for she knew he had pride in his wife and dearly he loved her.

And Hypatia lived and wandered and came to the wise ones of the Academy, for they danced with passion and thought with cleverness.
With great skill and power she spoke of White, but the wise ones of the Academy did not listen to her and laughed, for they all swore to Black and they all were clever and danced and thought, so Hypatia danced with them and left kind offerings.

Philon alone left the beautiful dance and listened to her with interest.
And Philon thought, "Oh wise Hypatia! How can you not see that the very Stars wear Black?
But it is only human to ignore and reject the reality that just passes by and love the lies that life gives daily!
And so Hypatia can only love the White walls of her School; blind she is, and wisdom will avail her not.
The powerful currents of the sea lead the unwary sailors astray and they fool themselves, for all they can see is the helm firmly in their grasps.
Just as unwary sailors we are, we drift from the truth and yet firmly believe we have it in our hand.
Yet wise Hypatia loves finding her errors more than she loves being right, hence she walks towards reality."

And Philon wanted to understand Hypatia and dance with Hypatia and revel in her embrace and in her beautiful dance, hence he said, "Oh Hypatia, please dance with Phylon!" and with grace and no expectation he waited for her answer.
And Hypatia listened to Phylon and liked his heart and with enthusiasm she accepted and gave her embrace to the dancer.

With the other and among the others Hypatia and Phylon danced, on beautiful notes and with beautiful movements that were beautiful, and with unseemly movements that were beautiful still, for the other become the same and then two others became One.
And Phylon understood that they were One, and trough Hypatia, he understood himself.

"Hypatia is wise and walks towards reality, and yet she mistakes the song of the Stars.
Hence if wise Hypatia can mistake, why can't Phylon, who is one with her?
Any fool can see their fellow's error, but only the wise seeks their own."

An Phylon though, for the flame of curiosity burned unto him, a flame that is stoked by any newly opened door.
Much he spoke with the wise and the fool, with the enemy and with the friend, much he read and much, indeed, he thought.

"I'm human, hence what I know to be true and wish to be true is often not true.
What are the ideas that I should fear the most?
Indeed, the words and the thoughts that soothe my ego and rise me above others.
Indeed, the words of those I deem wise, indeed the words of those I deem friends.
For those are the words that I will eagerly accept.
And since I am of the Academy, hence the idea of the men of the Academy I shall supremely distrust.

For those are the loved ideas, those are the most painful to prove wrong: but here I say to myself:
Hate your ideas oh Philo! Hate them without mercy! For love is wasted on them, and love Humanity instead.
Love humans with passion and dedication, with compassion and empathy and understanding love them.
Love humans above ideas.

I am human, I am the unwary sailor."


=====================================================================================
TOWARDS FEAR

The stars died for us to be, hence the town loved the stars and the folk often would speak to the stars and the stars would answer with miracles.

"Why do you speak to the stars?" - asked Ajivika.
"For they are wise and loving, and we puny humans need be worth of their love." - answered the Chief.
"Yet they answer not."
"Aren't the portents of life their answers?"
"If we need them to be."
"Ajivika has no mercy of their fellows.
 Do you want them to live in these harsh lands without the comfort of the stars?
 Did not the stars die for us?

 Yes, the lowly humans need the stars and their portents.
 For how could we survive alone? How could we understand?" <------ not clear!!

And Ajivika felt the unease of the Chief on themselves and their feelings danced together.

"To be human is to have fear, and to seek safety in our kin.
 Indeed, we live in a harsh land.
 Indeed, we fear loneliness and the unknown.
 But we choose the delusion that comforts us rather than the reality that alienates us.
 There is safety and familiarity in willing the stars of our kin.

"....."

"But if you love the stars, you must acknowledge what they are.
And they are stars and not humans, hence don't do what humans do."

----> makes us feel loved and supported rather than abandoned and neglected


We are familiar with humans, we want to make the Stars familiar.

The only sort of agency we can conceive of without great mental effort is humanlike agency.

- Aren't we alone?
- We are alone if we choose to be, and often we do for the way of loneliness is the wasy way.
But there is something vast and yet small, something humble and yet powerful that wants to be loved and will love you back.
- And yet you tell me that the very stars have no love, and no love for us.
- Indeed, love is not of the stars.
- Then what is that you talk about? What is it that is greater than me and yet yearns for my love?
- Seven billion humans. Humanity all.

  We need humans to thrive.
  We understand humans
  hence we try to make the universe human, to make it friendly and understandable
  but humans are friendlty
  humans love
  the universe is not human, the universe does not understand and does not love
We seek the Stars to be Human, yet they are not.
We want the Stars to care, yet they care not, for they are not Human.








"We are humans. Our kin is safety
 Does not the Daystar battle darkness and generously shine upon our crops?


Ajivika (them) knew of fear
To be Human, is to have fear.
To have fear is to crave for control, and for certainty.


our kin is safety.
isn;t safe to imagine the stars being our kin?


 Why would you want to live such ungrateful existence?

----> gives certainty and control
----> brings the problem down to thereal of understanding
----> makes us feel special

, young one. Have you no mercy for your fellows?"

can only hope for a sliver of their understanding.

But disaster, drought and disease struck

We want the universe to follow human patternas (ex: being caring or intelligent) to make it less alien and less uncaring
And more understandable, hence less frightening

But when we don't, we can have seven billions of friends.
- Now you make jest of human sorrow!

(ending?)
To be Human, is to have fear.
To be Human, is to have fear of being Human.

To be good, is to accept Humanity.
To be good, is to fight fear.


---->
  fear makes us want safety and control.

  lack of understanding gives fear
  hence we seek refuge in certainty
  this is part of being human, this is what we are.

  but to be good is to accept humanity and to fight fear


Being scared, is to be Human.

We are small, born to a big, scary world.
Hence we seek safety, hence we seek control.
This is to be Human.





Why do we ache for false understanding?
Because, in fear, we ache for control.

Yet we are small in a big world.

Gaia and Luna dance together a dance of harmony and the future of their dance is written in the past, and this is sin.
But dance heeds not of sin, for it only heeds of togetherness.

Gaia does not know.
Luna does not know.
For if they knew, what would be the point of the dance?



surrender to the dance, surrender to your partner's expression

surrender to being human, surrender to

Neither aches for power

Gaia does not ache for control.
Luna does not ache for control.
For if they did, how 


So how do I handle the fact that we can never be sure?
How do we cope with our own unreliable mind?
How do we navigate without knowing the current?
Even when we become aware of a vicious current only sometimes we can fight it and correcting our judgement but often we can only accept that we won't come to our destination. And still this latter knowledge is powerful indeed.

- Knowing about the current allows us to sometimes detect it and correct it.
- Knowing that we'll make mistakes allows me to stay more open minded and take myself less seriously.
- Use the errors of others to understand what MY own errors could be.

- Change of attitude: Admitting to myself that I'm wrong is very hard and requires a lot of effort, introspection, honesty and integrity, but it's the main way to become a better human being and ultimately empowering and liberating.

- We like simple answers. They lull us. But reality is complex, dirty and nuanced. This is its beauty. I embrace it.

Three Pillars of Virtuous Belief: Curiosity, Clarity, and Consistency.
Three Sins of Vicious Belief: Credulity, Confusion, and Compartmentalization.

================================================================
TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING



Accept that I am very easily manipulated by myself and by my social context.

*** AVAILABILITY HEURISTICS!? All I see is all that Exists
*** halo effect




------------------------------
Regression to the mean?
------------------------------

* The problem is that this is not how we experience our minds

* If I am unable to explain something in my own words, it's a sign I don't understand it


* We are unaware we make up stories to rationalize our biases
We make up stories and we intimately believe them

* priming, wysiati, narrow framing, inside view, preference reversal
I can avoid SOME, but I will ALWAYS be victim to them, so I always assume they are always operating on me
I can't fix it but I can learn to recognize it
AND it's always easier to find other's error rather than my own












=======================================================
TOWARDS MYSELF





I'm human. I'm not perfect. And it's ok. Really.
I laugh about myself.
I strive to see my flaws and do my best to correct them.

I will hold my opinion on things I don't know.

I will not cover my head when witnessing for Compassionate Humanism, unless as strictly and minimally necessary to protect myself from cold.

I will study how my mind can be manipulated and succumb to biases.

I will be competent

If I need to diminish someone I am doing it wrong

I accept that there is evil and there is good in me.
Which one prevails is my responsibility.

We are utterly blind to what happens in our heads; it is hard to acknowledge this even in face of evidence


Read travel, push myself out of my zone of comfort, let the acknowledgment of my ignorance become curiosity

If something feels uncomfortable but is not dangerous, i should probably try it.


When confronted with an inconsistent choice we make, our instinct is to rationalize the choice: we rarely
even consider that yes, our choice could actually have been inconsistent or wrong.

I am not my identity, I am not my ego.


Learn to say "I am wrong" "fair enough", first and foremist to myself, then to others

----------------
Being good is my goal, not my worth.
My worth is my want and my genuine effort to be good.
If I strive, if I do my very best every day and then some, then I am complete.
And the only way to honestly do this is to ask myself whether or not I am good.
I can never be certain of my success, I don't want to. But I can be certain of my effort.
-----------------


Study my own ignorance




=======================================================
TOWARDS OTHERS

Jiddu


Non-identity: everything that defines me divides me from the rest of humanity.
Being unique is not important. being human is.


Non-violence ahimsa
Non-Possessiveness Aparigraha

Asteya:  not take anything that is not willingly offered.

Communication joins us in consciousness, therefore the Internet is Sacred.
Riding a bicycle is an act of witnessing.

I will not cat call
I will not rape
I will respect consent

9. There is no one right way to live.
10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.

I will dedicate 1h per week to listen to my enemies and understand their arguments.


Thou shall solve your disputes with a dance off.
If you can't dance, at least be creative.


Dancing puts you on an enlightened plane of existence


The best way to eliminate assholes from the world is not to be one.
Even striving to follow the rules perfectly I risk that sometimes I will behave like an asshole, so I have to be vigilant of my own behaviour.


* Diffida di chi ti offre "la verita'"

* Violence is the obvious, mentally lazy solution. The problem is that its consequences are not obvious.

* Peace is more important than victory


like-mindedness breeds intolerance

=======================================================
TOWARDS THE PROPHET / TOWARDS DEATH

-------------------------------
I am often right, but this makes me arrogant.
I try to remind myself of all the times I have been wrong
Or I just try to laugh about myself.
-------------------------------

The Prophet may be wrong, but He's still a pretty rad dancer.


Education is a progressive discovery of our ignorance


A real friend takes you to task when you do something wrong
My friends don't make excuses for my errors.


- But you are the Prophet!
- Yet I am human! And I am one of many.




- Can you see those dancers there?
All they do is to move, to respond to each other.
Our soul is nothing but a dance happening in our brains.




========================
PRIDE

the only offece is offence to human rights
offence to human rights is offence to humanity
offence to humanity is offence to the prophet


you can destroy ideas
you can destroy people
but you can't destroy dance without destroying humanity




==========================================
NOTES
The focus is on humanity and there not yet anything about non-human animals.
