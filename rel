Dance Humanism
==============


There is no beginning.
There is no before.
There is no after.
The Laws say "we are" and fall silent and they are.
For the Laws, then and there.
For them, when and where.

The Laws danced together, and they were Universe.
And the Universe danced and became Light and became Stars.
And the Universe became Aware and made of Lightning and Stars, and the Universe became Human and many other things.
And Human looked and Human searched and Human understood and finally Human learn; and Human danced, for the Universe is dancing and they are dance.

We dance.
A sacrifice was made.
We dance, the stars died for us to be here.



If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare my Faith in Humanity.
If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare Dance Holy.





================================================================
TOWARDS BELIEF
"Hate ideas. Hate them without mercy. But love people. Love them with empathy and compassion."

Humans swore to Black, humans swore to White.
Hypatia lived and wandered and she was human and she swore to White, and she was Right, for she had Truth.
- Fools those who swore to Black - Hypatia said - Fools all of them!
But Hypatia thought.
- Fools, they are, but human, too. Humans can be fool. But I am human. Hence, I can be a fool!
Then, am I a fool?
I can't be, for I am Right and I have Truth.
But fools believe they are Right, and have Truth.
Alas! How am I different from a fool!?
Fools know they are Right, fools know the Truth.
Hence I will know I am not Right and that Truth is enemy of truth, and I will know myself a fool.
For if I decide what Truth is, and I decide I am no fool, how can I unfool myself? How can I seek truth?

Hypatia wondered, and stumbled upon an old fisherman.
- A sad woman are you, Hypatia, for you believe yourself a fool! - he said - My wife is a fool, but believes herself wise! Isn't she blessed and content?
But Hypatia retorted: - I'm not fool because Hypatia, but fool because human! What is the shame with being human? What is the wrong?
- Shame indeed you do to humanity, if you think it such a bunch of fools! - and he went on.
But against his harsh words smiled Hypatia, for she knew he loved his wife, dearly he loved and her.
<---------------------- parallelo piu' esplicito tra l'umanita' e la moglie del pescatore? "He was proud of her"?



The people of the Academy danced, thought and knew, and were passionate and wise and with passion and thought they all swore to Black.
So Philon danced with passion, thought and knew many things, and he swore to Black and by everyone was known as one of great wisdom.
Beautifully they danced, and Philon truly loved the dance and the dancers.











I'm human, hence what I wish to be true is often not true.

I am human, hence social, hence I belong to a group that shares my ideas.
These are the ideas I must be more critical of.

Admitting to myself that I'm wrong is very hard and requires a lot of effort, introspection, honesty and integrity, but it's the main way to become a better human being.






The future will be different, our ideas will need to adapt, and this includes our Beliefs.

=======================================================
TOWARDS MYSELF
I'm human. I'm not perfect. And it's ok. Really.
I laugh about myself.
I strive to see my flaws and do my best to correct them.

I will hold my opinion on things I don't know.

I will not cover my head when witnessing for Compassionate Humanism, unless as strictly and minimally necessary to protect myself from cold.

I will study how my mind can be manipulated and succumb to biases.

I will be competent

If I need to diminish someone I am doing it wrong

I accept that there is evil and there is good in me.

We are utterly blind to what happens in our heads; it is hard to acknowledge this even in face of evidence


=======================================================
TOWARDS OTHERS
Non-violence ahimsa
Non-Possessiveness Aparigraha

Asteya:  not take anything that is not willingly offered.

Communication joins us in consciousness, therefore the Internet is Sacred.
Riding a bicycle is an act of witnessing.

I will not cat call
I will not rape
I will respect consent

9. There is no one right way to live.
10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.

I will dedicate 1h per week to listen to my enemies and understand their arguments.


Thou shall solve your disputes with a dance off.
If you can't dance, at least be creative.


=======================================================
1. I am free to reject compassionate humanism.
2. Those who reject compassionate humanism shall suffer no consequences.
3. I accept and acknowledge that even the ideas I hold dearest may be wrong.
4. I change my ideas when they are shown to be wrong.
(If my ideas can be destroyed by truth, they must be)
5. I actively seek the weak points of my own ideas.
6. I strive to understand my enemies: I will not judge them before I can see myself in them.
7. I take full responsibility of my moral choices and my actions.
8. I doubt the righteousness and goodness of my actions
(It's the only way to see my errors and do true good).
9. I do good.

-------------------------------
I am often right, but this makes me arrogant.
I try to remind myself of all the times I have been wrong
Or I just try to laugh about myself.
-------------------------------

The Prophet may be wrong, but He's still a pretty rad dancer.
