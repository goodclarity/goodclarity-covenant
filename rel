Dance Humanism
==============


There is no beginning.
There is no before.
There is no after.
The Laws say "we are" and fall silent and they are.
For the Laws, then and there.
For them, when and where.

The Laws danced together, and they were Universe.
And the Universe danced and became Light and became Stars.
And the Universe became Aware and made of Lightning and Stars, and the Universe became Human and many other things.
And Human looked and Human searched and Human understood and finally Human learn; and Human danced, for the Universe is dancing and they are dance.

We dance.
A sacrifice was made.
We dance, the stars died for us to be here.






================================================================
COVENANTS

To Myself I say:

I am free to reject this Covenant, in all or in part, now or in the future.

Those who reject this Covenant shall suffer no consequences.

I accept and acknowledge that even the ideas I hold dearest may be wrong.

I change my ideas when they are shown to be wrong.
(If my ideas can be destroyed by truth, they must be.)

I actively seek the weak points of my own ideas.

I strive to understand my enemies: I will not judge them before I can see myself in them.

I take full responsibility of my moral choices and my actions.

I doubt the righteousness and goodness of my actions.
(Good intentions are not enough.)

I will do good.
(For my nature requires it.)

I will study this Covenant.

If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare my Faith in Humanity.
If against reason, if against evidence, I hereby declare Dance Holy.

With these words I pledge my efforts to the current Covenant until I pledge them to a newer one.





================================================================
TOWARDS BELIEF

"Hate ideas. Hate them without mercy. But love humans. Love them with empathy and compassion."


Humans swore to Black, humans swore to White.
Hypatia lived and wandered and she was human and she swore to White, and she was Right, for she had Truth.
"Fools those who swore to Black," Hypatia said, "Fools all of them!"
But Hypatia thought.
"Fools, they are, but human, too. Humans can be fool. But I am human. Hence, I can be a fool!
Then, am I a fool?
I can't be, for I am Right and I have Truth.
But fools believe they are Right, and have Truth.
Alas! How am I different from a fool!?
Fools know they are Right, fools know the Truth.
Hence I will know I am not Right and that Truth is enemy of truth, and I will know myself a fool.
For if I decide what Truth is, and I decide I am no fool, how can I unfool myself? How can I seek truth?"

Hypatia wondered, and stumbled upon an old fisherman.
"A sad woman are you, Hypatia, for you believe yourself a fool!" He said. "My wife is a fool, but believes herself wise! Isn't she blessed and content?"
But Hypatia retorted, "I am not fool because Hypatia, but fool because human! What is the shame with being human? What is the wrong?"
"Shame indeed you do to humanity, if you think it such a bunch of fools!" And he went on.
But against his harsh words smiled Hypatia, for she knew he had pride in his wife and dearly he loved her.

And Hypatia lived and wandered and came to the wise ones of the Academy, for they danced with passion and thought with cleverness.
With great skill and power she spoke of White, but the wise ones of the Academy did not listen to her and laughed, for they all swore to Black and they all were clever and danced and thought, so Hypatia danced with them and left kind offerings.

Philon alone left the beautiful dance and listened to her with interest.
And Philon thought, "Oh wise Hypatia! How can you not see that the very Stars wear Black?
But it is only human to ignore and reject the reality that just passes by and love the lies that life gives daily!
And so Hypatia can only love the White walls of her School; blind she is, and wisdom will avail her not.
The powerful currents of the sea lead the unwary sailors astray and they fool themselves, for all they can see is the helm firmly in their grasps.
Just as unwary sailors we are, we drift from the truth and yet firmly believe we have it in our hand.
Yet wise Hypatia loves finding her errors more than she loves being right, hence she walks towards reality."

And Philon wanted to understand Hypatia and dance with Hypatia and revel in her embrace and in her beautiful dance, hence he said, "Oh Hypatia, please dance with Phylon!" and with grace and no expectation he waited for her answer.
And Hypatia listened to Phylon and liked his heart and with enthusiasm she accepted and gave her embrace to the dancer.

With the other and among the others Hypatia and Phylon danced, on beautiful notes and with beautiful movements that were beautiful, and with unseemly movements that were beautiful still, for the other become the same and then two others became One.
And Phylon understood that they were One, and trough Hypatia, he understood himself.

"Hypatia is wise and walks towards reality, and yet she mistakes the song of the Stars.
Hence if wise Hypatia can mistake, why can't Phylon, who is one with her?
Any fool can see their fellow's error, but only the wise seeks their own."

An Phylon though, for the flame of curiosity burned unto him, a flame that is stoked by any newly opened door.
Much he spoke with the wise and the fool, with the enemy and with the friend, much he read and much, indeed, he thought.

"I'm human, hence what I know to be true and wish to be true is often not true.
What are the ideas that I should fear the most?
Indeed, the words and the thoughts that soothe my ego and rise me above others.
Indeed, the words of those I deem wise, indeed the words of those I deem friends.
For those are the words that I will eagerly accept.
And since I am of the Academy, hence the idea of the men of the Academy I shall supremely distrust.

For those are the loved ideas, those are the most painful to prove wrong: but here I say to myself:
Hate your ideas oh Philo! Hate them without mercy! For love is wasted on them, and love Humanity instead.
Love humans with passion and dedication, with compassion and empathy and understanding love them.
Love humans above ideas.

I am human, I am the unwary sailor."

So how do I handle the fact that we can never be sure?
How do we cope with our own unreliable mind?
How do we navigate without knowing the current?
Even when we become aware of a vicious current only sometimes we can fight it and correcting our judgement but often we can only accept that we won't come to our destination. And still this latter knowledge is powerful indeed.

- Knowing about the current allows us to sometimes detect it and correct it.
- Knowing that we'll make mistakes allows me to stay more open minded and take myself less seriously.
- Use the errors of others to understand what MY own errors could be.

- Change of attitude: Admitting to myself that I'm wrong is very hard and requires a lot of effort, introspection, honesty and integrity, but it's the main way to become a better human being and ultimately empowering and liberating.

- We like simple answers. They lull us. But reality is complex, dirty and nuanced. This is its beauty. I embrace it.

Three Pillars of Virtuous Belief: Curiosity, Clarity, and Consistency.
Three Sins of Vicious Belief: Credulity, Confusion, and Compartmentalization.

================================================================
TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING



Accept that I am very easily manipulated by myself and by my social context.

*** AVAILABILITY HEURISTICS!? All I see is all that Exists
*** halo effect




------------------------------
Regression to the mean?
------------------------------

* The problem is that this is not how we experience our minds

* If I am unable to explain something in my own words, it's a sign I don't understand it


* We are unaware we make up stories to rationalize our biases
We make up stories and we intimately believe them

* priming, wysiati, narrow framing, inside view, preference reversal
I can avoid SOME, but I will ALWAYS be victim to them, so I always assume they are always operating on me
I can't fix it but I can learn to recognize it
AND it's always easier to find other's error rather than my own












=======================================================
TOWARDS MYSELF





I'm human. I'm not perfect. And it's ok. Really.
I laugh about myself.
I strive to see my flaws and do my best to correct them.

I will hold my opinion on things I don't know.

I will not cover my head when witnessing for Compassionate Humanism, unless as strictly and minimally necessary to protect myself from cold.

I will study how my mind can be manipulated and succumb to biases.

I will be competent

If I need to diminish someone I am doing it wrong

I accept that there is evil and there is good in me.
Which one prevails is my responsibility.

We are utterly blind to what happens in our heads; it is hard to acknowledge this even in face of evidence


Read travel, push myself out of my zone of comfort, let the acknowledgment of my ignorance become curiosity

If something feels uncomfortable but is not dangerous, i should probably try it.


When confronted with an inconsistent choice we make, our instinct is to rationalize the choice: we rarely
even consider that yes, our choice could actually have been inconsistent or wrong.

I am not my identity, I am not my ego.


Learn to say "I am wrong" "fair enough", first and foremist to myself, then to others

----------------
Being good is my goal, not my worth.
My worth is my want and my genuine effort to be good.
If I strive, if I do my very best every day and then some, then I am complete.
And the only way to honestly do this is to ask myself whether or not I am good.
I can never be certain of my success, I don't want to. But I can be certain of my effort.

=======================================================
TOWARDS OTHERS

Jiddu


Non-identity: everything that defines me divides me from the rest of humanity.
Being unique is not important. being human is.


Non-violence ahimsa
Non-Possessiveness Aparigraha

Asteya:  not take anything that is not willingly offered.

Communication joins us in consciousness, therefore the Internet is Sacred.
Riding a bicycle is an act of witnessing.

I will not cat call
I will not rape
I will respect consent

9. There is no one right way to live.
10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.

I will dedicate 1h per week to listen to my enemies and understand their arguments.


Thou shall solve your disputes with a dance off.
If you can't dance, at least be creative.


Dancing puts you on an enlightened plane of existence


The best way to eliminate assholes from the world is not to be one.
Even striving to follow the rules perfectly I risk that sometimes I will behave like an asshole, so I have to be vigilant of my own behaviour.


* Diffida di chi ti offre "la verita'"

* Violence is the obvious, mentally lazy solution. The problem is that its consequences are not obvious.

* Peace is more important than victory



=======================================================
THE PROPHET

-------------------------------
I am often right, but this makes me arrogant.
I try to remind myself of all the times I have been wrong
Or I just try to laugh about myself.
-------------------------------

The Prophet may be wrong, but He's still a pretty rad dancer.

sharing authority and responsibility among peers.


Ultimately this is a religion not about what to think, but about HOW to think.
This is the thumb rule I keep when deciding what to include as its contents.


-----------> We need to be shown individual cases that surprise!!

Seeing an example of a completely normal person doing something surprisingly wrong helps us update our mental prototype.
we need to be shown individual cases that surprise
we infer the general from the particular
